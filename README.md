# HA_OpenSmartSpeaker
Open Smart Speaker aims to create a fully customizable and easily configurable smart speaker based around Home Assistant Voice PE source code.

Huge credit to Smart Home Circle for the code I used to setup the basic hardware. Much of the other code will be reverse engineered from the Voice PE code avainlable in this repo - https://github.com/esphome/home-assistant-voice-pe

Part lists, links, and 3D print files for the speaker housing will be coming soon.
